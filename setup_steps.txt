--- Steps to setup ---

1) Make sure that the HTTPS/HTTP communication is allowed on your Palo Alto 
   Networks Firewall management port as well as the IP addresses are permitted 
   from  the devices which run the script.



2) Edit "config.txt" as your environment, and save it.
   [example]
     PA IPaddress: 1.1.1.1
     XML-API admin: admin
     XML-API password: admin
     Botnet Report Filter Level: 4

   [Note]
   Do not edit the following, fail to read "config.txt" if you edit them .

      "PA IPaddress:" in line 1
      "XML-API admin:" in line 2
      "XML-API password:" in line 3
      "Botnet Report Filter Level:" in line 4
   
   if you want to retrive botnet reports from multiple devices or HA devices,
   you configure all the devices as the same format.



3) Make directory like "botnet" under your php directory, and put all the 
   downloaded scripts on this directory(ex php/botnet) and then permit the 
   script to "Read, Write, Execute" under this directory(ex php/botnet).

   your "php/botnet" should be as following.
   
　　php/botnet/config.txt			: Configuration file
　　php/botnet/botnet.php			: main script, kick this script with cron or time-scheduler
　　php/botnet/lib/KeyGen.php			: sub-script for API key generation 
　　php/botnet/lib/LoadConfig.php		: sub-script for load config.txt
　　php/botnet/lib/Logging.php			: sub-script for logging
　　php/botnet/lib/Mailout.php			: sub-script for email notification
　　php/botnet/lib/Output.php			: sub-script for check the filtering result
　　php/botnet/lib/Retrieve.php			: sub-script for retrieving/filtering botnet report
　　php/botnet/lib/ShowSystemInfo.php		: sub-script for get SN etc from Firewall



4) Adjust each php script to your environment and save it.

4-1) botnet.php
  - line2 			: timezone setting for log timestamp
  - line3 			: $display=1 means the logs come up on your browser 
				  if you kick the botnet.php script from your browser.
  - line20/Line 21		: select either to match your environment, and comment out the other.


4-2) KeyGen.php
  - line3/line4			: select either to match the communication ptorotol (HTTPS or HTTP)
						  and comment out the other.


4-3) ShowSystemInfo.php
  - line11/line12		: select either to match the communication ptorotol (HTTPS or HTTP)
						  and comment out the other.


4-4) Retrieve.php
  - line11/line12		: select either to match the communication ptorotol (HTTPS or HTTP)
						  and comment out the other.


4-5) Mailout.php
  - Configure the $params to match your SMTP server environment.

     [example] use SMTP server on Yahoo mail (Yahoo Japan mail)
     "host"    => "smtp.mail.yahoo.co.jp", // smtp server
     "port"    => "587",                   // smtp port
     "auth"    => true,                    // authentication on smtp server
     "username"  => "your Yahoo mail ID",  // user accout on smtp server
     "password"  => "your password",       // password for user account



  - Configure the notification email ($sender, $recipients, $subject, $body)

     $sender		: Type Notification Email sender or its email address
     [example] $sender = "sender@abc.com";

     $recipients	: Type Recipients email address, use ',' if multiple recipients
     [example] $recipients =　"user1@abc.co.jp, user2@abc.co.jp";

     $subject		: Notification email subject, customize this as you like

     $body		: Use default, but you can edit this as your own risk.



5) kick botnet.php script from cron on your favorite time for Linux/Mac.
   If Windows is used, make '.bat file' to kick botnet.php and set time-scheduler 
   to kick this '.bat file'on your favorite time.
   
   [example] botnet.bat
       C:\xampp\php\php.exe C:\xampp\htdocs\botnet\botnet.php
